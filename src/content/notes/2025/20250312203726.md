Lately, I've been separating as many of my dollars from big tech as possible. Today I shut down my AWS account after dumping Amazon devices and services over the last couple of weeks.

Fuck Jeff Bezos and the other gutless billionaires ruining our country (see my last quote post about WaPo if you need some more reasons).
