  <h1 class="page-heading">{{ title }}</h1>
  <p>I grew up in South Carolina, and now I live in North Carolina with my awesome wife and cat.</p>
  <p>I've messed around with computers pretty much my whole life, but I pursued a degree in English for reasons of which I'm still not entirely sure. Probably so I could write a sentence like that one.</p>

  <p>I graduated from the University of South Carolina in Columbia, S.C. I still root for the Gamecocks.</p>
  <p>I love living in the mountains. I love a good meal. I love my family and friends. Life is good. </p>
